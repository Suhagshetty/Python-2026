❓ Are These Topics Enough for DSA?
Short Answer: These fundamentals are essential, but you'll need additional DSA-specific knowledge.
✅ What You Have Covered:
Core syntax - Variables, operators, control flow
Essential data structures - Lists, dictionaries, tuples
Functions - Critical for implementing algorithms
OOP basics - Useful for complex data structure implementations
🎓 What's Still Needed for DSA:
Advanced Data Structures
Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
Stacks and Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Heaps)
Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)
Hash Tables (deeper dive)
Tries, Segment Trees, Disjoint Sets
Algorithm Concepts
Time & Space Complexity (Big O notation)
Recursion & Backtracking
Sorting Algorithms (Quick, Merge, Heap sort)
Searching Algorithms (Binary search variations)
Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms
Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
Sliding Window, Two Pointers
Bit Manipulation
Problem-Solving Patterns
Array/String manipulation techniques
Matrix traversal patterns
Tree traversal methods
Graph traversal strategies
📋 Recommended Next Steps:
Practice Platforms
Start with LeetCode Easy problems
Solve problems on HackerRank, CodeChef, or Codeforces
Focus on array and string problems first
